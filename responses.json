        "default": "It seems you're experiencing a common Minecraft issue. Here are some detailed steps to try:\n1. Reset your client: Close Minecraft completely, then relaunch it.\n2. Switch to Fabric: Fabric is a lightweight mod loader that often improves performance. Install it from fabricmc.net and use Fabric-compatible mods.\n3. Allocate more RAM: In the launcher, go to 'Installations' > your profile > 'More Options' and increase the '-Xmx' value (e.g., -Xmx4G for 4GB).\n4. Reduce render distance: Lower your render distance in Video Settings to reduce strain on your system.\n5. Update Java: Ensure you're using the latest version of Java for your Minecraft installation.\n6. Check for conflicting mods: If using mods, try removing them one by one to identify any conflicts.",

        "item duplication": "Item duplication is often caused by timing-related glitches or mod conflicts. Here's what you can do:\n1. Update Minecraft and all mods/plugins to their latest versions.\n2. Check server logs (if applicable) for any error messages related to item handling.\n3. Temporarily disable plugins/mods one by one to identify the cause.\n4. If using a server, ensure it's not overloaded - high server lag can cause item duplication.\n5. Verify the integrity of your world save file.\n6. If the issue persists, consider using an item clear plugin or command to remove duplicated items.",

        "redstone bug": "Redstone bugs can be complex due to timing issues and game mechanics. Try these solutions:\n1. Update to the latest Minecraft version, as many redstone bugs are fixed in updates.\n2. Rebuild the circuit with a slight delay (use more repeaters) to account for potential timing issues.\n3. Check for block updates that might be interfering with your circuit.\n4. Ensure your server's tick rate is stable (if on a server).\n5. Try alternative designs that achieve the same goal but use different mechanics.\n6. Use carpet mod or similar for more consistent redstone behavior in creative testing.",

        "mob glitch": "Mob glitches often stem from entity handling or chunk loading issues. Here's how to address them:\n1. Allocate more RAM to Minecraft (see default response for instructions).\n2. Install optimization mods like Lithium (Fabric) or AI Improvements (Forge) to enhance mob AI processing.\n3. Reduce mob cap using game rules or server plugins.\n4. Clear entities in the affected area using commands like '/kill @e[type=!player,distance=..50]'.\n5. Ensure your game and all mods are up to date.\n6. If on a server, check for plugin conflicts or consider using Paper/Purpur for better entity handling.",

        "inventory bug": "Inventory bugs can be caused by network lag, mod conflicts, or game overload. Try these fixes:\n1. Close and reopen your inventory.\n2. If items are stuck, try dropping and picking them up again.\n3. Use the '/clear' command (if you have permissions) to reset your inventory.\n4. Check your internet connection and reduce server load if possible.\n5. Update or temporarily remove inventory-modifying mods.\n6. Verify game file integrity through your launcher.",

        "chunk loading issue": "Chunk loading problems can significantly impact gameplay. Here's how to address them:\n1. Increase your allocated RAM (see default response).\n2. Reduce render distance and simulation distance in settings.\n3. Use optimization mods like Sodium (Fabric) or OptiFine (Forge) for better chunk rendering.\n4. Pre-generate chunks using tools like Chunky (for servers).\n5. Clear your Minecraft cache folder.\n6. If on a server, ensure it's not overloaded and consider upgrading hardware or using paper/purpur for better chunk management.",

        "spawn bug": "Spawn-related bugs can be tricky. Try these solutions:\n1. Check gamerules like 'doMobSpawning' and 'spawnRadius'.\n2. Ensure the spawn area meets the correct criteria (light level, block type, etc.) for the desired mob.\n3. Use commands like '/kill @e[type=!player]' to clear existing entities and allow fresh spawns.\n4. Verify that no mods or plugins are interfering with spawn mechanics.\n5. Regenerate the spawn chunks by deleting the region files (backup your world first!).\n6. If on a server, check for spawn protection settings that might be interfering.",

        "entity lag": "Entity lag can severely impact performance. Here's how to mitigate it:\n1. Use commands or plugins to regularly clear unnecessary entities.\n2. Implement stricter mob caps using game rules or server plugins.\n3. Use entity culling mods like EntityCulling (Fabric) or AI Improvements (Forge).\n4. Optimize mob farms to kill mobs faster or use collection systems that prevent entity buildup.\n5. If on a server, use plugins like ClearLag to manage entity counts.\n6. Consider using Paper/Purpur server software for better entity handling and performance.",

        "rendering glitch": "Rendering glitches can often be resolved by adjusting settings or updating drivers:\n1. Update your graphics drivers to the latest version.\n2. Adjust your video settings, particularly render distance, particles, and graphics quality.\n3. Toggle VSync on or off.\n4. If using shaders, try disabling them or updating to the latest version.\n5. Use optimization mods like Sodium (Fabric) or OptiFine (Forge) for improved rendering.\n6. Verify game file integrity and consider a clean reinstall if issues persist."

    "dupe_reply": {
        "default": "Duplication glitches can be complex and often exploit-specific. Here are general steps to address them:\n1. Update Minecraft and all mods/plugins to the latest versions.\n2. Report the specific duplication method to the server admin or mod author.\n3. Avoid using or spreading information about the exploit to prevent abuse.\n4. If on a server, suggest implementing anti-cheat plugins or custom scripts to detect and prevent known duplication methods.\n5. For temporary mitigation, consider disabling related features (e.g., specific redstone components, entity interactions) until a fix is available.\n6. Keep an eye on official changelogs and community forums for acknowledged bugs and their fixes.",

        "dupe": "Classic duplication glitches often exploit timing or server-client desync. To address:\n1. Ensure your game and server (if applicable) are fully up to date.\n2. Check for any mod or plugin conflicts that might be causing item handling issues.\n3. If on a server, verify that the server isn't overloaded, as high lag can sometimes cause item duplication.\n4. Consider implementing item verification plugins or scripts to detect and remove duplicated items.\n5. Temporarily disable features related to the duplication method until a fix is available.\n6. Report the specific method to Mojang or the relevant mod/plugin author for investigation.",

        "duplication glitch": "To effectively address a duplication glitch, we need specific information:\n1. Describe the exact steps to reproduce the glitch.\n2.
